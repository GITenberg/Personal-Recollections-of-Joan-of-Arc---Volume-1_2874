description: Regarded by many as the most luminous example of Twain's work, this historical
  novel chronicles the French heroine's life, as purportedly told by her longtime
  friend -- Sieur Louis de Conté. A panorama of stirring scenes recount Joan's childhood
  in Domremy, the story of her voices, the fight for Orleans, the splendid march to
  Rheims, and much more. An amazing record that disclosed Twain's unrestrained admiration
  for Joan's nobility of character, the book is matchless in its workmanship -- one
  of Twain's lesser-known novels that will charm and delightfully surprise his admirers
  and devotees.
